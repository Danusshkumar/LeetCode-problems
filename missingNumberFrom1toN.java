268. Missing Number
Given an array nums containing n distinct numbers in the range [0, n], return the only number in the range that is missing from the array.

Explanation:
All the elements in the array will be distinct from 1 to n with one number missing.
Then differenc of (sum of numbers from 1 to n) and the (sum of element in that array) will give us the (missing number)

            arraySum += arr[i];
